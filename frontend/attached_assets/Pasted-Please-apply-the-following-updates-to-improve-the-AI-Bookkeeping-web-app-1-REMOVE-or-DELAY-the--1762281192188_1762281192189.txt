Please apply the following updates to improve the AI-Bookkeeping web app:

1. REMOVE or DELAY the lifetime-deal pop-up. 
   • Show it only after the user scrolls 50% down or after 15 seconds.
   • Make sure it never blocks navigation.

2. UPDATE the hero section:  
   • Headline: “AI bookkeeping that actually understands UAE VAT.”  
   • Subheading: “Automate invoices, VAT, P&L, and trial balance — built for SMEs in the UAE.”  
   • Add three small badges: “FTA-Compliant,” “Bank-Grade Security,” “Powered by AI.”  
   • Keep two main CTAs: “Start free trial” (primary) and “Watch how it works” (secondary).

3. ADD product visuals:  
   • Show a dashboard screenshot (P&L + VAT summary + AI insights).  
   • Include a short animated GIF/video showing AI categorising expenses.  
   • Add 3–4 feature cards for: AI Categorisation, VAT & Tax Compliance, Real-Time Reports, and Accountant Collaboration.

4. ADD “How It Works” section:  
   • Step 1: Create company (with TRN).  
   • Step 2: Import bank or card data.  
   • Step 3: AI categorises and posts entries.  
   • Step 4: Download VAT/P&L reports.

5. IMPROVE pricing section:  
   • Keep 3 tiers — Starter (Free), Growth (AED 299), Firm (AED 799).  
   • Mark Growth as “Most Popular.”  
   • Add text: “All prices in AED · Cancel anytime · No setup fees.”

6. ADD trust & social proof:  
   • 2–3 testimonial cards.  
   • A footer with company address, contact email, privacy policy, and “Made with ❤️ in Dubai.”  

7. FIX navigation & mobile layout:  
   • Ensure the top menu works smoothly on mobile.  
   • Retain bilingual (EN/AR) and RTL support.

8. OPTIONAL: Add a small section showing integration logos (“Works with Stripe, PayPal, and Excel”) for credibility.

Use Tailwind or styled components (consistent with the current React codebase).  
Keep all existing logic, bilingual support, ROI calculator, and data-test-id attributes.  
Do NOT replace the React framework — just apply these layout, text, and visual updates.
