Please add the following two sections to the company profile page in our React + TypeScript app.

Use functional components and TypeScript types. Use tailwind or existing project styling conventions. Ensure all fields are controlled inputs with labels, error validation for required fields, and save logic.

📦 SECTION 1: Company Information

Component name: `CompanyInfoSection`

Fields:
- Company Name (text, required)
- Legal Structure (dropdown: Sole Proprietorship, LLC, Corporation, Partnership, Other; required)
- Industry (dropdown with typeahead or free input; optional)
- Business Registration Number (text, optional)
- Business Address (textarea or address fields; required)
- Contact Phone (text, optional)
- Contact Email (text, optional)
- Website URL (text, optional)
- Upload Logo (file upload with preview; optional)

Group into logical blocks with spacing. Use labels and placeholder text where appropriate. Use `<input type="file">` for logo upload and render a thumbnail preview if uploaded.

🧾 SECTION 2: Tax & Compliance Settings

Component name: `TaxComplianceSection`

Fields:
- TRN / VAT Number (text, required if UAE)
- Tax Registration Type (dropdown: Standard, Flat Rate, Non-registered, Other; optional)
- VAT Filing Frequency (dropdown: Monthly, Quarterly, Annually; required if VAT registered)
- Tax Registration Effective Date (date picker; optional)
- Corporate Tax ID (text, optional)

If country is UAE (you can mock this for now), mark VAT fields as required. Later we can add validation based on location. Ensure dates are ISO compliant and easily parsed.

✅ Additional Notes:
- Wrap both components under a `CompanyProfileForm` container
- Include a "Save" button at bottom that collects all fields and outputs JSON to console for now
- Add state validation for required fields (e.g. empty company name or VAT number should show red border and helper text)
- Ensure responsiveness on mobile

Let me know once this is implemented so I can help build the next section (Accounting Settings and HR).
