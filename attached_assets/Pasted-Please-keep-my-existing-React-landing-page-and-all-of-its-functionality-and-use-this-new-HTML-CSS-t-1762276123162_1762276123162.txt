Please keep my existing React landing page and all of its functionality, and use this new HTML/CSS template purely as a DESIGN + COPY reference.

Concretely:

1. DO NOT replace the React app with static HTML.
2. KEEP these features exactly as they are:
   - Bilingual EN/AR support (including RTL behavior)
   - Interactive ROI calculator
   - Animated dashboard preview
   - data-testid attributes for tests
   - Email popup / lifetime deal logic

3. UPDATE THE LANDING PAGE LAYOUT to follow the structure of the template:
   - Hero section:
     - Clear headline like “AI bookkeeping that actually understands UAE VAT”
     - Subheading focused on UAE SMEs
     - Primary CTA: “Start free trial”
     - Secondary CTA: “Watch how it works”
     - 2–3 small benefit pills (FTA-compliant, AI-powered, secure)
   - Trust strip (logos / segments) under the hero
   - “Features” section with 3–4 feature cards:
     - AI categorisation
     - UAE VAT & bilingual tax invoices
     - P&L + Trial Balance
     - Collaboration with accountants
   - “How it works” section with 4 steps
   - “Pricing” section:
     - 3 plans: Starter, Growth, Firm
     - Highlight Growth as “Most popular”
   - Testimonials and FAQ sections
   - Final CTA section + footer with links

4. IMPLEMENT THE DESIGN IN REACT:
   - Recreate the template styling using CSS Modules, styled-components, or Tailwind (whatever the project already uses).
   - Match the general look & feel:
     - Dark SaaS style
     - Pill buttons, cards, and grids like in the template
     - Modern spacing and typography
   - Keep my current brand name and logo; just adapt colors/layout based on the template.

5. HOOK EXISTING COMPONENTS INTO THE NEW LAYOUT:
   - Place the animated dashboard preview inside the hero or “How it works” section.
   - Place the ROI calculator inside the Features or Pricing area as a highlighted component.
   - Keep the email popup behavior, but make sure its styling matches the new design.

6. PRESERVE TESTS:
   - Keep all existing data-testid attributes.
   - If you move components into new sections, keep the same test IDs so my tests don’t break.

In short: 
Use the new HTML/CSS as a blueprint for layout, copy, and visual styles, but keep everything React-based, preserve all existing behavior, and integrate my current interactive components into the new structure.
